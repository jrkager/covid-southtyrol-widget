## Deployment to AWS Lambda

### serverless
The script can be deployed to AWS Lambda either by hand (not recommended) or via the `serverless` tool.
`serverless` can be installed manually (see https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/ for instructions) or via npm (`npm install serverless serverless-python-requirements`). To complete the initial setup, run `serverless` and follow the instructions.

To deploy, simply run `serverless deploy`.
